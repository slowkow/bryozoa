# Summary #
Bryan Quach worked on this project during the summer of 2009. Among other
things, he produced two tables of use to me: `valid` and `invalid`. You can
see his original file called `BryozoneUploadFile_06aug09.xls`
[here](http://code.google.com/p/bryozoa/source/browse/bryan). I exported the
sheets into tab-delimited files. In the MySQL database, I refer to them as
`bryan_valid` and `bryan_invalid`.

For this project, I only used table `bryan_valid`.
